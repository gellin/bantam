# bantam
An advanced PHP backdoor management tool, with a lightweight server footprint, multi-threaded communication, and an advanced payload generation and obfuscation tool. Features end to end encryption with request unique encryption keys designed to bypass WAF and IDS systems. It encorperates several 
payload randomization and obfuscation techniques to help prevent detection when encryption is not possible. Bantam is an ideal tool for linux PHP post exploitation privesc making it a breeze to upload enumeration scripts. Bantam also has a plugin system making it easy to add scripts and features to the ui. 
It is programmed in C# and runs on windows, and Linux using wine.

## Features
#### End to end request & response encryption - [encryption flow](documentation/encryption.png)
- AES-256 bit encryption on request & response data using openssl or mcrypt
- Response encryption keys are newly generated and embedded into the request payload for every request making every response unique, preventing detection from WAF and IDS systems
- Request encryption keys can be embedded using a pre-shared key/iv, or use a pre-shared key with a randomly generated IV that is passed through a known request variable making every request signature unique
